### Modulo Operation Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)
Basic Properties
```bash
a % x < x
If x > a → a % x = a (no change)
```
- Modulo never increases a number

- It only reduces or keeps it same

Key Competitive Programming Observations
- If k > smallest element, then smallest element cannot change
- a1 % x = a1   (if x > a1)

### GCD of Differences Pattern
When we want to make numbers equal using operations like:
- subtraction
- modulo
- difference operations
